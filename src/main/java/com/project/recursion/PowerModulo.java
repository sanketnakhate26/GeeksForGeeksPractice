/*
Given a number and its reverse. Find that number raised to the power of its own reverse.
Note: As answers can be very large, print the result modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2, R = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The reverse of 2 is 2 and after raising power of 2 by 2 we get 4 which gives remainder as 4 when divided by 1000000007.
